- If the snake hits itself, the game ends
- Snake is rainbow colored, changes color throughout game
- If the user navigates away, snake game pauses
- Crazy Mode makes the snake change speeds randomly
- Pellets are instructor's faces and they make a sound when they get eaten
- Cat mode turns the snake into Nyan Cat

### Instructor's Goals for Next Check In

* Goal 1: _eg. Create snake head constructor that draws itself on the canvas_

* Goal 2: _eg. Stop snake from moving past the boundry of the canvas when moving - write tests_

* Goal 3: _eg. Configure jshint and .jshintrc_

_Note: Instructor/Groups can add additional goals beyond 3. Grading for the next check in will be based on completion of goals_

### Stretch Goals

* _ie. Goals that are not required to meet the checkin, but would be good to have. Completion may result in extra credit points_
