### Work Completed

- [Comments on issue #71](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/issues/71)
- [Current PR #75](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd/pulls)

Link to and describe the code/research you have completed so far.

- Worked through the creact tutorial, [repo here](https://github.com/saylerb/creact-starter)
- Talked to Sal about high-level concepts of how the react router works. He pointed me towards [his blog post](http://s-espinosa.github.io/blogposts/up_to_speed.html).
- Mark Miranda pointed me towards the react-router-tutorial. I found this page on ["Production-ish Server"](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial/tree/master/lessons/11-productionish-server) especially helpful.
- Sunny, who has been learning React/Redux recently, helped me look at different ways of implementing history when routing. We found out which ways were deprecated, and that browserHistory is the perferred way of doing things.
