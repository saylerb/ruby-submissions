### Which Assignments and Why?
- Which assignments did you choose to complete this week?
- Why did you choose these assignments?
  * Goals Assignment - I wanted to start thinking about what I'm doing to do
    after Turing
  * Side Hustle - While looking for a Job, I'd like to work on something fun
    and light-hearted

### Submitted Assignments

## Goals Assignment

### Identify

List three individual learning goals that you would like to accomplish over the
next year.

* Goal 1: Build an application with an a secure API that generates tokens for
  authentication
* Goal 2: Build a small application with a functional programming language
* Goal 3: Research and code simple machine learning algorithmn

### Define

* Goal 1: Learn more about Security and web applications
   - Current status: 
      - recently researching how to make API requests without jQuery w/
        authentication
      - learned about the problems involved with CORS
      - learned about options on how to make Rails APIs more secure
        - work on preventing XSS my throwing cookies into headers
        - work on incorporating token generation of something like JWT into a
          project
   - Success
      - Encorporate JWT into a backend API application (can be something
        simple, like IdeaBox)
   - Mentors: Ian Douglas suggested to be some resources for looking into web
     application security
   - Resources
      - [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/)
      - [Article on Rails API
        security](http://sakurity.com/blog/2015/03/04/hybrid_api_auth.html)

* Goal 2: Get some experience with a functional programming language 
   - Languages of interest include Haskell, Elixir, Elm, Scala, or Clojure
   - Current status
     - Bought Elixir and Haskell books, have done some Exercisms in Elixir and
       Haskell
   - Success
     - Build a web application in Elixir (using the Phenonix web framework) or
       Elm
     - OR use a functional language to host a static website (e.g. a Blog)
   - Mentors: Andrew Thal has done mulitple talks on Elixir
     - [Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell)
     - [Elixir book](https://amzn.com/1680501666)
   - Resources
     - [So you want to be functional programmer (mutiple part series on
       Medium)](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-1-1f15e387e536#.xnk8d03l0)
     - [Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell)
     - [Elixir book](https://amzn.com/1680501666)

* Goal 3: Machine Learning  
   - Current status
     - Completed half of [6.00.2x edX course from MIT on Computation
       (Python)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-4)
     - Starting looking at [Coursera course from Stanford University on Machine
       Learning
(Matlab)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
     - Armstrong posse has worked on learning about simple regressions, working
       towards learning about neural networks
   - Mentors: Aaron Greenspan is a great resource for mathematical knowlege and
     machine learning
   - Success:
     - Finish 6.00.2x (this will give me a good background to approach the
       Coursera course)
     - Learn some linear algebra and work through the Coursera source
     - Implement a simple regression program in Python
   - Resources
     - MOOCs (listed above)
     - Turing students (especially Armstrong posse)

## Side-Hustle Assignment

Making a thing is a super power that you now have. It helps you stand out among
your fellow developers. It helps you hone your skills with good motivation. It
could even save the world, help a community, make you some cash or just make
one person's day a little weirder.

What should you make?


### Ideas 
  - Oreo Clicker game (in a functional language)
    - What: a Game where you click an Oreo and try to maximize clicks per second, High scores are stored
    - MVP: a one-page app with a picture on an Oreo, you click it and it increments a counter
    - Why: for fun!
    - Resources: There are some people I know from Turing with functional programming experience that I can reach out to
    - Plan: might write a blog post about learning a functional language for a simple application. Progressive Web application, possibly?

  - Simple Rails API that generates tokens
    - What: a simple API (eg. IdeaBox) that generates tokens
    - MVP: IdeaBox with token-generated authentication
    - Why: to learn about application Security and prevent vulnerbilities in future apps I build
    - Resources: some Turing mentors with an interest in Security. Ian Douglas suggested that many companies are looking for devs with interest in security
    - Plan: write about learning about improving security in an app I've built at Turing. I was thinking Ideabox/ThoughtBox

  - Machine Learning Python Script
    - What: a simple linear regression application on a real dataset
    - MVP: a command-line script
    - Why: to learn more about computational programming
    - Resources: Armstrong posse, mentors, MOOCs
    - Plan: write a simple regression script with Python. Start working on Coursera course, possibly porting assignments from Matlab to Python
